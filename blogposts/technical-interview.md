# Comprehensive Guide to Technical Interviews and Coding Interview Preparation

The technical interview, also known as a tech interview or software engineer interview, is a specialized and rigorous process designed to test your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and personality. While technical interviews can be intimidating, proper preparation can significantly improve your performance and confidence.

## What to Expect in a Technical Interview

A technical interview is unlike any other job interview. It involves challenges and assignments that resemble exams more than typical question-and-answer sessions. The purpose is to assess how you tackle real-world problems, similar to those you'll encounter on the job.

### Stages of a Technical Interview

Tech interviews typically consist of three stages:

üìû **1st Stage: Technical Screening Interview (Phone or Video)**  
This initial stage is a short social and technical screen interview, lasting 15-30 minutes. Its purpose is to assess your qualifications and enthusiasm for the role.

üìù **2nd Stage: Remote Coding Interview/Assignment**  
Some companies conduct a remote coding challenge to test your coding skills. This may take the form of a phone call, video conference, or homework-type assignment and typically lasts a few hours.

üè¢ **3rd and Final Stage: Onsite Interview/Whiteboarding Challenge**  
The onsite interview involves in-person coding challenges completed on a whiteboard in front of the interviewer(s). This stage can last 1-2 hours, with the entire onsite technical interview lasting several hours to a full day.

## Examples of Technical Interview Processes at Popular Tech Companies

Every company's technical interview process varies. Here are examples from some popular tech companies:

- **Google**: Initial phone or Google Hangout interview (~30-60 min); onsite tech interview (~4 hours with 4 separate interviews)
- **Facebook**: Initial technical screening interview (30-50 min); onsite interview (1 full day)
- **Uber**: Initial phone screen (30-60 min); in-person interview (1 full day with 6 back-to-back personal and technical interviews)

## How to Prepare for a Technical Interview

Preparation for a technical interview depends on the seniority of the role you're applying for. Junior positions may have less intense interviews compared to senior roles. Research the company's technical interview process and practice common technical interview questions and coding challenges to improve your chances of success.
